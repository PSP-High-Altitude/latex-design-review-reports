\section{Spaceshot Requirements} \label{section:requirements}
This section includes our highest-level requirements for the spaceshot project. Throughout the rest of the report other sections will reference the specific requirement a particular design is satisfying, in order to motivate it. Each requirement ID in the rest of this report is a clickable hyperlink to the appropriate part of \Cref{section:system-appendix}, where all of our requirements are tabulated, with their derivations when appropriate.

Some of these requirements are dependent on whether or not we expend the first stage of the vehicle. Our team has decided to not include first stage recovery as an internal stakeholder requirement. However, there may or may not be external factors that require us to recover the stage. Currently, we have worked on designs for subsystems like avionics and recovery that will be included in the first stage, if and only if it is to be recovered. For the rest of this report, requirements that only exist if the first stage is to be recovered are marked with a \(*\), and requirements that only exist if the first stage is able to be expended are marked with a \(\dagger\).

\subsection{Internal Stakeholder Requirements}
Our stakeholder requirements are derived from entities involved in the development, launch, or regulation of an amateur rocket. In this case, the customer of this rocket is the Purdue Space Program High Altitude team. These were decided in a team-wide planning meeting early in the vehicle design process.

\subsection{External Stakeholder Requirements}
These are requirements set by either PSP or PSPHA members.

Although 100 km is achievable with a single motor, mixing and casting a motor of this size introduces challenges as these processes are overseen  by Zucrow Labs\footnote{For a motor that big, we would need to use more than 100 lb of propellant, which the Hobart mixer in ZL6 cannot even cast a single grain of at one time. With two stages, we will still have to cast multiple batches, however, we can still cast a single grain at once --- avoiding the problem of two mixes per grain.}. Additionally, the multistage design meets the teamâ€™s vision and creates design challenges that the team wants to take on.} \\ \hline

Documentation tends to be lacking, and whenever a core member leaves the team, limited knowledge gets transferred, resulting in having to start certain research from the beginning. This will also standardize the explanation of the function of a system across the teams and pass on our knowledge to future teams and groups.} \\ \hline

\subsection{Functional Requirements}


\subsubsection{Flight-Critical Requirements}
After considering all of our stakeholder requirements, we derived the high level requirements for our vehicle to achieve its mission. Functional requirements are more focused on what the overall rocket has to do and not how. It will also have the physical components stated for a rocket to be a rocket. Also, some of these requirements are dependent on whether or not we expend the first stage. Requirements that only exist if the first stage is recovered are marked with a \(*\), and requirements that only exist if the first stage is expended are marked with a \(\dagger\).
