\section{De-Spin Equations} \label{section:despin-appendix}
Three primary sources have been compiled to verify the feasibility of yo-yo despin: a Princeton course \cite{princeton-course} (masses released tangentially), an unclassified NASA paper \cite{eom-despin-dtic} (masses released radially), and an Attitude Dynamics textbook \cite{curtis-orbital-mech} (masses released either tangentially or radially). When using the assumptions that: (1) the cord unwinds at a constant rate equal to the vehicleâ€™s initial angular velocity and (2) final angular velocity is 0, each source gives the same equation for the corresponding type of release.

\subsection{Princeton Course Slides (MAE 342)}

If \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the satellite excluding the yo-yo masses,

\[ \Psi = 1 + \frac{I}{mr^2} \]

If the final angular velocity is zero:

\[ l =  \]
